I hope you like work I develop in less of 1 week without full time dedication due to I'm working, I know there are some points of the task incomplete, I would have liked could finish all of them but unfortunately it was not possible, there are 2 main point:
	- Docker deployment: I've had several issues with that, I couldn't make work app with mongoDB, It works fine in local but when I deploy it to docker it doesn't work, I explored different possible issues like wrong variables, Dockerfile or visibility between containers. I researched but nothing I found worked. I deployed to openshifth but didnÂ´t work there either.
	- Sucurity, Test and sonarqube: I didn't have time to learn how those work in Golang
	
Probably this is an disadvantage to promote next stage, but after all I'm proud what I achieve in no time working with technologies I've never work before and knowledge I acquired thankful this project. Happen whatever happen, it was worh it :)
